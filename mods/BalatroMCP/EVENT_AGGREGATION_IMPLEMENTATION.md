# Event Aggregation Implementation - Issue #324

## Overview
Fixed the BalatroMCP event aggregation bugs by properly integrating the existing `event_aggregator.lua` module into the event flow. The aggregator now batches events within a 100ms window before sending them to the event bus.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main.lua Integration
- Connected the event aggregator to the event bus after initialization
- Added `in_scoring_sequence` flag to track when we're in a scoring cascade
- Added explicit flush after scoring sequences complete
- Added hook for `Card.calculate_joker` to track joker triggers during cascades
- Added update loop hook installation check

### 2. Event Bus Client Enhancement
- Added backward compatibility redirect in `send_event()` method
- Any direct calls to `event_bus:send_event()` now automatically route through the aggregator
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Event Aggregator Improvements
- Fixed initialization to properly receive event bus reference after init
- Already had robust batching logic with:
  - 100ms batch window (configurable)
  - Max batch size of 50 events
  - High priority event immediate flush
  - Game state deduplication per frame

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Joker triggers during scoring are marked as low priority for batching
- Game states are aggregated to keep only latest per frame
- Scoring sequence completion triggers immediate flush

## Performance Impact
- Complex joker cascades (100+ triggers) now batch into 2-3 HTTP requests instead of 100+
- Maintains event ordering through timestamp sorting
- High priority events (errors) still flush immediately
- Backward compatible with any existing code

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite including:
- `test_event_aggregation.lua` - Unit tests for aggregation logic
- `test_joker_cascade.lua` - Performance tests simulating complex cascades
- Tests verify batching behavior, priority handling, and game state aggregation

## Definition of Done
- [x] Event aggregation working in BalatroMCP
- [x] Performance tests show <100ms for 100+ events
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Unit tests for aggregation logic

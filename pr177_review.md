## Code Review Feedback

### Summary
This PR addresses issue #146 by updating docker-compose v1 syntax to v2 (`docker-compose` → `docker compose`). While the docker syntax changes are correct, the PR includes unrelated files that need to be removed.

### Issues Found

**Priority: HIGH**
- **Unrelated Files**: The PR includes documentation files from issue #145 that are not related to docker-compose migration:
  - `docs/issue_145_additional_retriggers.md` (289 lines about Balatro game retrigger optimization)
  - `docs/issue_145_performance_analysis.md` (315 lines about performance optimization)
  
- **Review Artifacts**: The PR includes review artifacts that should not be committed:
  - `review_comment.md` (appears to be from a different PR about CI workflow cleanup)
  - `review_feedback.md` (also from a different PR about CI consolidation)

**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **CI Failures**: All CI checks are failing, but this appears to be due to Rust toolchain installation issues in the Docker build process, not related to your changes

### Docker Compose Changes Review
The actual docker-compose v1 to v2 syntax updates are **correct and complete**:
- ✅ All shell scripts properly updated
- ✅ GitHub workflow files in archives updated
- ✅ Comments in docker-compose.memgraph.yml updated
- ✅ No instances of `docker-compose` commands remain

### Recommendations
1. **Remove unrelated files**:
   ```bash
   git rm docs/issue_145_additional_retriggers.md
   git rm docs/issue_145_performance_analysis.md
   git rm review_comment.md
   git rm review_feedback.md
   git commit -m "fix: Remove unrelated files from PR"
   ```

2. **Keep only docker-compose related changes**:
   - `.github/workflows-archive/docker-ci.yml`
   - `.github/workflows-archive/main-ci.yml`
   - `jimbot/deployment/scripts/*.sh`
   - `jimbot/memgraph/docker-compose.memgraph.yml`
   - `scripts/run-ci-docker.sh`
   - `scripts/setup-dev-env.sh`

3. **CI Issues**: The CI failures appear to be infrastructure-related (Rust toolchain installation). Consider re-running CI after removing unrelated files.

### Verification
I've confirmed that all `docker-compose` commands have been properly updated to `docker compose` v2 syntax across the codebase. Once the unrelated files are removed, this PR will correctly fix issue #146.

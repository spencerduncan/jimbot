## Code Review Feedback

### Summary
This PR aims to simplify the CI pipeline by removing redundant workflows. While the intent is good, there are merge conflicts that need to be resolved before this can be reviewed properly.

### Issues Found

**Priority: HIGH**
- **Merge Conflicts**: The PR has merge conflicts with the base branch (main). These must be resolved before the changes can be properly reviewed and merged.
- **Changed Files Review**: The PR shows changes to 15 files, including several documentation files and configuration files that may not be directly related to CI workflow cleanup.

### Recommendations
1. Please rebase this branch on the latest main branch to resolve conflicts
2. After resolving conflicts, ensure that:
   - All language-specific checks remain functional in main-ci.yml
   - No critical CI functionality is lost
   - The documentation accurately reflects the new simplified structure

### Next Steps
Please resolve the merge conflicts and push the updated branch. Once conflicts are resolved, I'll perform a detailed review of the changes.

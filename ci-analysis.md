# CI Pipeline Analysis and Failures

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Format Check Job
- **Python Black**: FAILED - Multiple files need reformatting (empty __init__.py files)
- **Python isort**: FAILED - Many import sorting issues across the codebase
- **StyLua**: NOT INSTALLED - Cannot test Lua formatting
- **clang-format-15**: NOT INSTALLED - Cannot test C++ formatting
- **buf (protobuf)**: NOT INSTALLED - Cannot test protobuf formatting

### 2. Missing System Dependencies
- clang-format-15 (C++ formatter)
- luarocks (for Lua tooling)
- golang (for buf installation)
- stylua (Lua formatter)

### 3. Python-specific Issues
- pyproject.toml had an unescaped backslash causing configuration errors
- Many Python files have formatting issues (mostly empty __init__.py files)
- Import sorting is incorrect in many files

## Identified Problems

1. **Formatting Issues**
   - Empty __init__.py files need proper formatting
   - Import statements are not properly sorted
   - Configuration file had syntax error

2. **Missing Tools**
   - CI expects system-level tools that aren't installed
   - Need sudo access or alternative installation methods

3. **Environment Issues**
   - Python packages need virtual environment
   - System package installation requires sudo

## Next Steps

1. Fix Python formatting issues by running black and isort
2. Create Docker-based CI testing environment
3. Update CI workflow to handle missing tools gracefully
4. Consider using pre-commit hooks for local formatting

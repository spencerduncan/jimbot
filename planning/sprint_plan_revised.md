# Revised Sprint Plan - JimBot Development

## Executive Summary

This revised sprint plan addresses critical dependency issues and timing
conflicts identified in the original planning. The plan follows a 10-week
timeline with Week 0 foundation setup, incorporating phased implementation
approaches and parallel development tracks enabled by mock implementations.

### Key Changes from Original Plan

1. **Event Bus First**: Implemented in phases starting Week 0 to unblock all
   consumers
2. **Resource Coordinator Early**: Set up Week 0 before Ray/Claude need GPU/API
   coordination
3. **Mock-Driven Development**: Each component provides mocks to unblock
   dependencies
4. **Infrastructure Before Code**: CI/CD, Docker, and monitoring setup precedes
   implementation
5. **Realistic Parallelization**: Clear separation of what can be done in
   parallel vs sequentially

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Weekly integration tests
   - Impact: Could delay Week 7 checkpoint

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Early benchmarking
   - Impact: May require architecture changes

### Resource Risks

1. **Developer Availability**
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation for handoffs
   - Impact: Could delay specific components

2. **Memory Pressure**
   - Mitigation: Resource Coordinator enforcement
   - Impact: May require allocation adjustments

## Team Structure

## Dependencies Established

```
Event Bus (#52)
├── Blocks: Event Bus Consumers (#7, #9, #17)
└── Requires: Protocol Buffers (#54)

Resource Coordinator (#53)
└── Blocks: Resource Coordinator Integration (#13)

Protocol Buffers (#54)
└── Blocks: Event Bus (#52), All Consumers

CI/CD Pipeline (#55)
└── Required for: All Rust components

Docker Compose (#56)
└── Requires: Event Bus and Resource Coordinator images
```

## Sprint 1 Priorities

Based on the dependencies, the Sprint 1 priorities are:

1. **Protocol Buffer Schemas (#54)** - No dependencies, can start immediately
2. **Event Bus Implementation (#52)** - Critical path for all consumers
3. **Rust Development Guide (#57)** - Enable team productivity
4. **Resource Coordinator (#53)** - Parallel development possible

## Communication Summary

Key messages communicated to the team:

1. **Performance-critical components** moving to Rust
2. **Existing working code** (BalatroMCP, Ray, Claude) stays in original
   languages
3. **Backward compatibility** maintained for all interfaces
4. **Clear benefits**: 5-10x performance, better memory usage, type safety

## Metrics

- **New Issues Created**: 7 (6 infrastructure + 1 tracking)
- **Existing Issues Updated**: 7
- **Labels Created**: 10
- **Total Active Rust Issues**: 14 (7 new + 7 updated)

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Begin Event Bus implementation (#52)
2. **This Week**:
   - Set up Rust development environment
   - Create Protocol Buffer schemas (#54)
   - Start CI/CD pipeline setup (#55)
3. **Sprint Planning**: Use tracking issue #58 for coordination

## Success Indicators

- ✅ All critical infrastructure has issues
- ✅ Dependencies properly linked
- ✅ Clear implementation language specified
- ✅ Team notified via issue comments
- ✅ Tracking mechanism in place

## Conclusion

The GitHub issues are now fully aligned with the Rust migration plan. The team
has clear guidance on priorities, dependencies, and implementation languages.
Sprint 1 can begin immediately with Protocol Buffer schemas and Event Bus
implementation.
